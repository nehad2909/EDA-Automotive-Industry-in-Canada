The objective of this project is to carry out an Analysis of Vehicle Sales in Canada. <br>

## Why this industry? <br>
• Auto manufacturing contributes over $16 billion to Canadian GDP. <br>
• Manufacturing sales of motor vehicles and parts were $74.2 billion in 2020. <br>
• Vehicles are the second largest Canadian export by value at $42.9 billion in 2020. <br>
• The Detroit-Windsor crossing represents the highest number of loaded truck container crossings annually. <br>
• Auto manufacturing accounts for 135,000 direct jobs in Canada. <br>
• For each one auto assembly job, approximately ten other jobs are created in upstream and downstream activities. <br>
• Canada is the 11th leading vehicle producer in the world. <br>
• Canada is dependent on exporting outside of its own borders. <br> <br>

## What do we want to do?
Investors are always looking for new business opportunities to increase their capital, while expecting from their investment a high return with the probability of minimum loss.<br><br>
Therefore, some of the investors in Canada see great potential in the vehicle market. However, they need a better understanding of the vehicle sales trends in the Canadian market which would give them a better overview of where to focus their investment. <br> <br>
Our Project group will create a descriptive analytical product to examine the historical behavior of vehicles sales with inventory turnover while analyzing the prospects of electric cars in Canada.  
This could serve as a business tool for identifying the potential of vehicle sales while helping investors in concise decision making. <br> <br>

## What do we want to Analyze?
This first part of the project is just about exploring data from the different data sets. However, in the end the goal is to generate answers to the following questions: <br>
1. Which province/geographical region generates the highest revenue yearly? Which province has the highest sales per capita? 
2. Does the sale price by unit tend to be constant, or does it show significant variations by province or yearly?
3. Does the season of the year influence car sales in Canada? In which season of the year are more vehicles sold?
4. Which of the Provinces has the lowest new car inventory turnover
5. Are those provinces that have a rebate policy the ones that sell the most electric cars per each 100.000 inhabitants?
6. Does the value of the rebate offered by the provinces have an influence on the volume of electric cars registration?
